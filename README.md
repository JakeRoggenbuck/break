# break

## About
`break` is a Unix command-line utility for destruction of programs.<br>
The `break` utility requires a file in the current directory called `GNObreakfile`, `breakfile`, or `Breakfile`.

## Use
If you have a breakfile, simply type `./break` or `python3 break` into command-line to start the irreversible, randomized destruction of your hard-written programs.

## Breakfile
Breakfiles have the keyword `break` and a name of a file
```python
break filename.c
```
There is another example at `./example/Breakfile`
