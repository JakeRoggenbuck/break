# break
`break` is a Unix command-line utility for destruction of programs.
The `break` utility requires a file in the current directory called `GNObreakfile`, `breakfile`, or `Breakfile`.

Simply type `break` into command-line to start the irreversible, randomized destruction of your hard-written programs.
