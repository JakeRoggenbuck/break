# cbreak
`cbreak` is a Unix command-line utility for destruction of programs.
The `cbreak` utility requires a file in the current directory called `GNObreakfile`, `breakfile`, or `Breakfile`.

Simply type `cbreak` into command-line to start the irreversible, randomized destruction of your hard-written programs.
